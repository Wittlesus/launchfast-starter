        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "The cheapest production-ready stack for a solo founder is: Next.js (free), NextAuth v5 (free), Neon or Supabase for the database (free tier), Vercel for hosting (free tier), and Stripe for payments (no monthly fee, just 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction). Your total monthly cost can be $0 until you start getting paying customers. The main cost is your time setting it up, which is why boilerplates like LaunchFast ($79 one-time) exist -- they pre-wire this entire stack so you can skip weeks of integration work."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Use a boilerplate if you want to validate your idea quickly and your product fits within the boilerplate's architecture. Auth, payments, email, and database integration are solved problems -- there is no competitive advantage in building them from scratch. Build from scratch only if you need a non-standard tech stack, have very specific architectural requirements, or want to deeply understand every line of code. For most solo founders, a $79-$199 boilerplate pays for itself within the first day of saved development time."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "A SaaS with under 1,000 users can run for $0-$50 per month using free tiers. Vercel's free tier handles hobby projects, Supabase or Neon offer free Postgres, and NextAuth is open source. As you grow to 1,000-10,000 users, expect $50-$200 per month for hosting, database, and email services. The biggest variable costs are AI API usage (if applicable) and email volume. Stripe charges 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction with no monthly fee, so payments scale with your revenue."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Next.js is the best framework for most solo developers in 2026. It has the largest ecosystem, the most learning resources, the widest hosting support (especially Vercel), and handles both frontend and backend in one codebase. SvelteKit is a strong alternative if you prefer Svelte's syntax and want smaller bundle sizes. Avoid picking a framework based on hype -- choose the one with the best ecosystem for your use case, which for SaaS products is almost always Next.js."

        "text": "No. NextAuth (Auth.js) v5 is completely free and open source. It supports OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.), magic links, and credentials-based auth. It works with any database through adapters. Paid options like Clerk ($25/month after free tier) offer better UI components and user management dashboards out of the box, but they are not necessary. Supabase Auth is also free within Supabase's free tier. For most solo founders, NextAuth v5 is the right choice -- it is free, flexible, and widely supported."

    <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">Solo founders need to be ruthlessly efficient with tool choices. Every hour spent evaluating, configuring, or switching tools is an hour you're not building your product or talking to customers.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">This guide covers the best tools across every category you need to build and launch a SaaS in 2026. For each tool, we include honest pricing, real pros and cons, and what it's actually best for. No affiliate links influencing the ranking -- just genuine recommendations from builders who have shipped with these tools.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">We've organized the 21 tools into 7 categories with 3 picks each, so you can mix and match based on your specific needs and budget.</p>

  <!-- ===== FAQ Section ===== -->
  <section id="faq" class="mx-auto max-w-4xl px-6 py-12">
    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-12">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="space-y-6">

      <div class="rounded-2xl border border-gray-800 bg-gray-900/30 p-8">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">What's the cheapest tech stack for a solo founder?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">The cheapest production-ready stack is: Next.js (free), NextAuth v5 (free), Neon or Supabase for the database (free tier), Vercel for hosting (free tier), and Stripe for payments (no monthly fee, just 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction). Your total monthly cost can be $0 until you start getting paying customers. The main cost is your time setting it up, which is why boilerplates like LaunchFast ($79 one-time) exist -- they pre-wire this entire stack so you can skip weeks of integration work.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl border border-gray-800 bg-gray-900/30 p-8">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">Should I use a boilerplate or build from scratch?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">Use a boilerplate if you want to validate your idea quickly and your product fits within the boilerplate's architecture. Auth, payments, email, and database integration are solved problems -- there is no competitive advantage in building them from scratch. Build from scratch only if you need a non-standard tech stack, have very specific architectural requirements, or want to deeply understand every line of code. For most solo founders, a $79-$199 boilerplate pays for itself within the first day of saved development time.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl border border-gray-800 bg-gray-900/30 p-8">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">How much does it cost to run a SaaS as a solo founder?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">A SaaS with under 1,000 users can run for $0-$50 per month using free tiers. Vercel's free tier handles hobby projects, Supabase or Neon offer free Postgres, and NextAuth is open source. As you grow to 1,000-10,000 users, expect $50-$200 per month for hosting, database, and email services. The biggest variable costs are AI API usage (if applicable) and email volume. Stripe charges 2.9% + 30 cents per transaction with no monthly fee, so payments scale with your revenue.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl border border-gray-800 bg-gray-900/30 p-8">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">Which framework is best for a solo developer?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">Next.js is the best framework for most solo developers in 2026. It has the largest ecosystem, the most learning resources, the widest hosting support (especially Vercel), and handles both frontend and backend in one codebase. SvelteKit is a strong alternative if you prefer Svelte's syntax and want smaller bundle sizes. Avoid picking a framework based on hype -- choose the one with the best ecosystem for your use case, which for SaaS products is almost always Next.js.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rounded-2xl border border-gray-800 bg-gray-900/30 p-8">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-bold text-white mb-3">Do I need to pay for authentication?</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">No. NextAuth (Auth.js) v5 is completely free and open source. It supports OAuth providers (Google, GitHub, etc.), magic links, and credentials-based auth. It works with any database through adapters. Paid options like Clerk ($25/month after free tier) offer better UI components and user management dashboards out of the box, but they are not necessary. Supabase Auth is also free within Supabase's free tier. For most solo founders, NextAuth v5 is the right choice -- it is free, flexible, and widely supported.</p>
