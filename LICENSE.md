# LaunchFast Commercial License

**Copyright (c) 2026 LaunchFast. All rights reserved.**

This is a **commercial software license**, not an open-source license. By purchasing and using this software, you agree to the following terms.

## License Grant

### Standard License (1 Developer)

The Standard License grants **one (1) individual developer** the right to:

- Use the source code in **unlimited personal and commercial projects**
- Modify the source code to suit your needs
- Build and deploy applications, SaaS products, websites, and tools using this code
- Use the code in client projects (the end product you deliver, not the template itself)

### Pro License (Up to 5 Developers)

The Pro License grants **up to five (5) developers** within the same organization the right to all of the above. All licensed developers must be part of the same company or team that purchased the license.

## What You Can Build

There are no restrictions on what you build with this code. You can create:

- SaaS applications
- Client websites and web apps
- Internal business tools
- Mobile app backends
- AI-powered applications
- Anything else you can think of

If you build it with our code and sell it as a product or service, that's great -- that's exactly what this code is for.

## Restrictions

You **may not**:

1. **Redistribute the source code** in any form as a template, boilerplate, starter kit, code generator, or similar developer tool
2. **Resell, sublicense, or share** the source code (or substantial portions of it) with developers outside your license tier
3. **Publish the source code** in a public repository or make it freely available
4. **Create a competing product** that is substantially similar to the original template and marketed as a development starting point

To put it plainly: build whatever products you want, but don't sell or give away the template itself.

## Ownership

The original source code, architecture, and documentation remain the intellectual property of LaunchFast. This license grants you usage rights -- it does not transfer ownership.

Any applications, products, and services you build using this code are entirely yours.

## No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Termination

This license is effective until terminated. It terminates automatically if you:

- Violate any of the restrictions above
- Request and receive a refund for your purchase

Upon termination, you must delete all copies of the source code. Any products you've already built and deployed with the code may continue to operate.

## Questions

If you're unsure whether your use case is covered by this license, email **patricksereyouch@gmail.com** and ask. We're happy to clarify.
