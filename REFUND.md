# Refund Policy

**Last updated: February 14, 2026**

We want you to be happy with your purchase. If you're not, we'll make it right.

## 14-Day Money-Back Guarantee

We offer a **14-day, no-questions-asked refund** on all purchases. If you're not satisfied for any reason -- the code doesn't fit your needs, you changed your mind, or it's just not for you -- we'll give you a full refund.

No hoops to jump through. No long forms to fill out.

## How to Request a Refund

1. **Email us** at **patricksereyouch@gmail.com**
2. Include your **order number** or the **email address** you used to purchase
3. That's it

## What Happens Next

- We'll confirm your refund request within **1 business day**
- Your refund will be processed within **5 business days**
- The refund goes back to your original payment method via Stripe

## After a Refund

Once your refund is processed:

- Your license to use the source code is **revoked**
- You must **delete all copies** of the source code from your systems
- Any projects you've already deployed may continue to run, but you may not use the template code for new projects

## The 14-Day Window

The refund window starts from the date of purchase. Refund requests received after 14 days will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, but we cannot guarantee approval beyond the 14-day window.
