# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 14, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how LaunchFast ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you purchase our digital products. We keep it simple because our data practices are simple.

## The Short Version

We collect almost nothing. We don't run a web app with user accounts. We sell digital downloads. The only data we have about you is what Stripe (our payment processor) shares with us when you make a purchase.

## What Data We Collect

### Data collected through Stripe (payment processor)

When you purchase a product, Stripe collects and processes:
- Your **email address**
- Your **payment information** (credit card, billing address)
- **Transaction details** (what you bought, when, and how much you paid)

We receive your email address and transaction details from Stripe. We **never** see or store your full credit card number -- Stripe handles all of that securely on their end.

### Data we do NOT collect

- We do not have user accounts on our sales site
- We do not use cookies for tracking on our landing page
- We do not use analytics tools that collect personal data
- We do not collect usage data from the products you build
- Our products (source code templates) run on your own infrastructure -- we have no access to your users' data

## How We Use Your Data

We use your email address for exactly two things:

1. **Delivering your purchase** -- sending you download links and license information
2. **Product updates** -- occasionally notifying you about important updates to the code you purchased (security fixes, major releases)

That's it. No marketing newsletters unless you explicitly opt in. No spam.

## Third-Party Services

- **Stripe** processes payments. Their privacy policy: [stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy)
- **GitHub** hosts our source code repositories. Their privacy policy: [docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies)
- **Vercel** hosts our landing page. Their privacy policy: [vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy)

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with any other third parties.

## Data Retention

We retain your email address and purchase records for as long as necessary to:
- Provide you with product updates
- Handle refund requests (within our 14-day refund window)
- Comply with legal and tax obligations

## Your Rights (GDPR & CCPA)

Regardless of where you live, you have the right to:

- **Access** -- Request a copy of any personal data we hold about you
- **Correction** -- Ask us to correct inaccurate data
- **Deletion** -- Ask us to delete your personal data (subject to legal retention requirements like tax records)
- **Portability** -- Receive your data in a standard, machine-readable format
- **Objection** -- Object to processing of your data for any purpose beyond delivering your purchase

To exercise any of these rights, email **patricksereyouch@gmail.com** with your request. We'll respond within 30 days.

## Data Security

We follow reasonable security practices to protect your information. Since we store very little data ourselves (Stripe handles the sensitive stuff), our attack surface is minimal. We use HTTPS everywhere and follow secure development practices.

## Children's Privacy

We do not knowingly sell products to or collect data from children under 16. Our products are developer tools intended for adult professionals.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top. We encourage you to review this page periodically.
