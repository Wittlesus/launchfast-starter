# LaunchFast - The Next.js SaaS Boilerplate

**Short Description:**
Ship your SaaS in days, not months. Next.js 15 + Auth + Stripe + AI + Email -- everything pre-configured.

## Stop Building Infrastructure. Start Building Your Product.

Tired of spending weeks setting up auth, payments, and email before you can even start building your actual product?

You have a great SaaS idea. But before you can write a single line of product code, you need to wire up authentication, integrate Stripe subscriptions, configure email delivery, set up a database, build a landing page, design a dashboard, and handle protected routes. That is weeks of tedious, repetitive work -- and none of it is unique to your product.

**LaunchFast changes that.**

LaunchFast is a production-ready Next.js boilerplate with everything pre-configured so you can skip the setup grind and start building the features that actually matter. Clone the repo, add your API keys, and deploy. Your SaaS is live.

## What's Included

### Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript

Built on the latest Next.js 15 with the App Router architecture and full TypeScript support. Server components, server actions, and the modern React patterns you need -- all set up correctly from the start.

### Authentication (NextAuth.js v5)

Google and GitHub OAuth pre-configured with NextAuth.js v5. Users can sign up and log in immediately. Session management, account linking, and secure token handling are all wired up and ready to go.

### Stripe Payments

A complete payment system, not just a checkout button. Includes:

- Subscription management with recurring billing
- Checkout sessions for seamless payment flow
- Customer billing portal for self-service plan changes
- Webhook handler for real-time payment event processing
- A polished 3-tier pricing page ready to convert visitors into paying customers

### AI Integration

An Anthropic Claude API route with authentication protection built in. Your users get AI-powered features out of the box, and you get a clean pattern to extend with your own AI functionality.

### Database (Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL)

A fully defined schema with User, Account, and Session models using Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL. Migrations, type-safe queries, and a clean data layer -- all configured and ready for you to extend with your own models.

### Email (Resend)

Transactional email powered by Resend. Includes a welcome email template and a reusable utility function so you can add new email types in minutes.

### Landing Page

A conversion-focused landing page with a hero section, feature grid, and pricing cards. Professionally structured and easy to customize with your own copy, colors, and branding.

### Dashboard

A fully functional dashboard with sidebar navigation, stats cards, an AI demo interface, and billing management. Your users get a polished experience from day one.

### Protected Routes

Middleware-based authentication protection for your app routes. Public pages stay public, private pages stay private. No manual checks scattered across your codebase.

### Deployment

Vercel-ready with a vercel.json configuration file included. Push to GitHub, connect to Vercel, and your SaaS is live in minutes.

## The Math Is Simple

How many hours would it take you to set up auth, Stripe webhooks, a pricing page, email templates, and an AI endpoint from scratch?

Be honest. It is at least 40 hours of focused work -- and that is if everything goes right on the first try.

LaunchFast saves you 40+ hours of setup. At $99, that is less than $2.50 per hour. Compare that to your hourly rate. This pays for itself before lunch on day one.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What tech stack does it use?

LaunchFast is built with Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, NextAuth.js v5, Stripe, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL, Resend for email, and Anthropic Claude for AI integration. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and is configured for deployment on Vercel.

### Can I use it for multiple projects?

The Standard license ($99) covers one project. If you want to use LaunchFast for multiple projects, the Pro license ($149) gives you unlimited project usage.

### Do I need a Stripe account?

Yes, you will need a Stripe account to process payments. Stripe offers free account creation, and you only pay Stripe's standard transaction fees when you start processing real payments. LaunchFast handles all the integration code for you.

### What if I don't want the AI integration?

The AI integration is completely modular. You can remove the AI route and demo component without affecting anything else in the boilerplate. Every feature is built to work independently.

### Is there a refund policy?

Due to the nature of digital products and source code, all sales are final. However, if you encounter a significant technical issue that prevents you from using LaunchFast, reach out and we will work with you to resolve it.
