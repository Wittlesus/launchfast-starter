# Terms of Service

**Last updated: February 14, 2026**

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your purchase and use of digital products sold through LaunchFast ("we," "us," or "our"). By purchasing any product, you agree to these Terms.

## What You're Buying

When you purchase a LaunchFast product, you're buying a **license to use source code** -- not a subscription, not a hosted service. You receive a digital download of source code, templates, and related files. There is no ongoing service obligation on our part beyond delivering the files you purchased.

## License Tiers

We offer two license tiers:

- **Standard License ($79):** A personal use license for **1 developer**. You may use the code in unlimited personal and commercial projects. You may not share the source code with other developers.

- **Pro License ($119):** A team license for **up to 5 developers** within the same organization. All licensed developers may use the code in unlimited personal and commercial projects.

See our [License](LICENSE.md) for full details.

## What You Can Do

- Use the code to build any application (personal, commercial, client work)
- Modify the code however you want
- Deploy unlimited projects built with the code
- Use it forever -- your license does not expire

## What You Cannot Do

- **Redistribute the source code** as a template, boilerplate, starter kit, or competing product
- Share, resell, or sublicense the source code itself to others outside your license tier
- Claim the original template code as your own creation for resale as a template

To be clear: you can absolutely build and sell SaaS products, websites, and applications using this code. You just can't resell the *template itself* as a development tool.

## No Warranty

The software is provided **"as is"** without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the code will be error-free, secure, or suitable for any particular purpose. You are responsible for testing and validating the code before using it in production.

## Refund Policy

We offer a **14-day money-back guarantee**, no questions asked. If you're not satisfied for any reason, email us within 14 days of purchase with your order number and we'll process a full refund. See our [Refund Policy](REFUND.md) for details.

After a refund is processed, your license is revoked and you must delete all copies of the source code.

## Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenue, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from:

- Your use or inability to use the software
- Any bugs, errors, or vulnerabilities in the code
- Any unauthorized access to or alteration of your applications built with the code
- Any third-party services or integrations referenced in the code

Our total liability for any claim arising from these Terms shall not exceed the amount you paid for the product.

## Intellectual Property

The original source code, design, and documentation remain our intellectual property. Your license grants you usage rights as described in these Terms, but does not transfer ownership of the underlying intellectual property.

Any applications, products, or services you build using the code are yours.

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we'll update the "Last updated" date at the top. Continued use of the product after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.

## Governing Law

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be resolved in accordance with applicable federal and state law.
